					<p class=lead>Instructions on how to define music that you'd
						like Methodical to identify in your composition.</p>
					<h2 id=overview-doctype>Structure of the Music Definition</h2>
					<p>The music definition is simply a list of declarations. See
						below an example of music defined for a touch on 6 bells:</p>
					<pre>"Queens" = 135246
"Titums" = 142536
"Rollup" = 456$
"546" = 546$</pre>
					<p>A music declaration is made up of 3 parts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the name of music alias that we are declaring surrounded
							by double quotes</li>
						<li>the equals sign "="</li>
						<li>the music that you're looking for expressed in
							regular-expression notation</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						A regular expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text
						string for describing a search pattern. You can think of regular
						expressions as wildcards on steroids. Some examples with
						explanations are provided in the next section below. To find out
						more about regular expressions there is plenty of information
						available on the internet. Try <a
							href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/quickstart.html"
							target="_blank">this</a> for starters.
					</p>
					<h2 id=overview-doctype>Examples of Music Declarations</h2>

					<p>The most basic regular expression consists of a series of
						literal characters, such as 456. Methodical will match any row
						created by your composition where 456 appear in that order.</p>
					<pre>"My Music" = 456</pre>
					<p>
						The music declaration given here will match the following rows:
						123<strong>456</strong>, <strong>456</strong>321 and 3<strong>456</strong>12
					</p>
					<pre>"My Music" = 456$</pre>
					<p>The $ character matches the end of a row, and ^ matches the
						start of a row, so if you wanted to define music that starts with
						1234 you'd define your music as:</p>
					<pre>"1234 at start" = ^1234</pre>
					<p>and if you wanted to define music that ends with 1234 you
						define your music as:</p>
					<pre>"1234 at end" = 1234$</pre>
