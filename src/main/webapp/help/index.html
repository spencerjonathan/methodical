					<p class=lead>Instructions on how to define compositions in
						Methodical.</p>
					<h2 id=overview-doctype>Structure of a Composition Definition</h2>
					<p>The composition is made up of 4 types of declaration,
						"METHOD"s, "CALL"s, "PART"s and the "COMPOSITION":</p>
					<pre>METHOD M1 = "Cambridge Surprise Minor"

CALL B = 14
CALL S = 1234

PART P1 = { P P P P P }
COMPOSITION = { M1 P1 }</pre>

					<p>Let's look at these parts in more detail.</p>
					<h3>Declaring a METHOD</h3>
					<p>A Method declaration is made up of 4 parts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the keyword "METHOD"</li>
						<li>the name of Method alias that we are declaring</li>
						<li>the equals sign "="</li>
						<li>the title of the method surrounded by double quotes</li>
					</ul>
					<pre>METHOD M1 = "Cambridge Surprise Minor"</pre>
					<p>In our example above we are declaring one Method. It is
						"Cambridge Surprise Minor" and we're giving it the alias "M1"</p>
					<p>Each alias must be unique and consists of a letter followed
						by 0 or more letters or numbers
					<p>
					<h3>Declaring a CALL</h3>
					<p>A Call declaration is made up of 4 parts:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the keyword "CALL"</li>
						<li>the name of Call alias that we are declaring</li>
						<li>the equals sign "="</li>
						<li>the place notation of the call</li>
					</ul>

					<pre>CALL B = 14
CALL S = 1234</pre>
					<p>In our example above we are declaring 2 calls. One has alias
						"B" and place notation 14, and the second has alias "S" and place
						notation 1234.</p>
					<p>One special call is already defined for us with alias "P".
						This represents a plain lead with no call at the end. It is not
						possible to declare and Method, Call or Part aliases with
						identifier "P"</p>
					<p>Each alias must be unique and consists of a letter followed
						by 0 or more letters or numbers
					<p>
					<h3>Declaring a PART</h3>
					<p>Part declarations provide a short-hand for writing out the
						composition in full. They allow you to give a sequence of Method
						changes and Calls an alias. The example below shows the
						declaration for 5 plain leads:</p>
					<pre>PART PLAINCOURSE = { P P P P P }</pre>


					<p>Parts can be nested - that is, a Part can contain one or
						more other parts. The example below shows nested Part
						declarations:</p>

					<pre>PART WH = { P P B P B }
PART W = { P P B P P }
PART WHW = { WH W }</pre>

					<p>It is not necessary to have any Parts. A valid composition
						definition could consist of only a "METHOD" declaration and a
						"COMPOSITION" declaration.
					<h3>Declaring a COMPOSITION</h3>
					<p>The COMPOSITION is a special PART in that it is the
						definition of the composition to be processed by Methodical when
						you click Submit. &nbsp;The syntax for defining the COMPOSITION is
						slightly different in that we don't give it an alias. &nbsp;You
						can only define one composition. &nbsp;Otherwise, the same rules
						apply for defining the COMPOSITION as for a PART.</p>
					<p>
						The COMPOSITION declaration is made up of 3 parts:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>the keyword "COMPOSITION"</li>
						<li>the equals sign "="<br></li>
						<li>the list of METHOD, CALL and PART aliases that make up
							the composition surrounded by brackets { }</li>
					</ul>
					<pre>COMPOSITION = { M1 P1 }</pre>
					
					<p>The following is an example of how you could define a 720 WHW x 3 touch of Cambridge Surprise Minor:</p>
					<pre>METHOD M1 = "Cambridge Surprise Minor"

CALL B = 14
CALL S = 1234

PART WH = { P P B P B }
PART W = { P P B P P }
PART WHW = { WH W }
COMPOSITION = { M1 WHW WHW WHW }</pre>
